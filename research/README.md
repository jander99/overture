## Simplified Architecture (Key Changes)

### Configuration Hierarchy: 2 Levels (Not 4)

**Simplified:**
```
Project Settings (.overture/ in project)
    ‚Üì
User Settings (~/.overture/)
```

**Removed:**
- ‚ùå Enterprise managed settings
- ‚ùå Team-specific configuration
- ‚ùå Complex precedence rules

### Sharing = Git

No special "team" features needed:
- **Share your config**: `git push`
- **Use someone's config**: `git clone`
- **Contribute**: Standard git PR workflow

### What Overture Does

**In Scope:**
- Generate plugin structures
- Validate configurations
- Build plugins
- Sync to Claude Code / Copilot
- Generate CLAUDE.md
- Detect duplication
- Smart rebuilds (Nx)

**Out of Scope:**
- ~~Team management~~ (git handles this)
- ~~Enterprise features~~
- ~~Collaboration tools~~ (git provides)
- ~~Profile management~~

See [archive/README.md](./archive/README.md) for details.

## Key Findings Summary

### 1. Plugin Composition (Validated ‚úÖ)

Plugins bundle **5 component types**:
1. MCP Servers (foundation - provide tools)
2. Subagents (specialized AI agents)
3. Skills (modular capabilities)
4. Slash Commands (user-invoked workflows)
5. Hooks (event-driven automation)

### 2. Technology Stack Decision (‚úÖ)

**Node.js + TypeScript + Nx + PNPM**

Why: Nx is perfect for dependency graph management and smart rebuilds. Everything-as-a-project model maps directly to our domain.

### 3. CLAUDE.md as Coordination Hub (‚úÖ)

Use CLAUDE.md as single source of truth:
- Project conventions
- Tool documentation
- Architecture overview
- Commands and workflows

Generate `copilot-instructions.md` from CLAUDE.md.

### 4. Simplified Configuration (‚úÖ)

Two levels only:
- User preferences (`~/.overture/`)
- Project settings (`.overture/` - committed to git)

Git handles all sharing and collaboration.

### 5. Nx Architecture (‚úÖ)

Each component is an Nx project:
- Automatic dependency tracking
- Smart rebuilds (only changed components)
- Parallel builds
- Local caching
- Visual dependency graph

## Implementation Phases

**Phase 1** (Weeks 1-4): Core Nx workspace + CLI + generators
**Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8): Smart dependencies + affected builds
**Phase 3** (Weeks 9-12): CLAUDE.md generation + sync
**Phase 4** (Weeks 13-16): Polish + distribution (NPM, Homebrew)

## Research Methodology

1. **Parallel Search**: 5+ simultaneous web searches
2. **Source Diversity**: Official docs + community guides + GitHub
3. **Structured Documentation**: Consistent template for features
4. **Cross-Cutting Analysis**: Identified overlaps and patterns
5. **Theory Validation**: Tested plugin-centric architecture
6. **Simplification**: Removed 30-40% scope (team/enterprise features)

## Sources

**Total**: 35+ unique sources across all documents

**Quality**: All official documentation cited, cross-referenced with community examples

**Validation**: High confidence, ready for implementation

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Research complete
2. ‚úÖ Architecture validated
3. ‚úÖ Documentation simplified
4. ‚è≥ Clean up team/enterprise references in main docs (optional before starting)
5. ‚è≥ Set up initial Nx workspace
6. ‚è≥ Begin Phase 1 implementation

## Document Maintenance Notes

### Documents needing cleanup (low priority):
- `implementation-plan.md` - Remove Nx Cloud team caching sections
- `architecture-recommendations.md` - Remove enterprise configuration sections
- `user-experience.md` - Remove team lead persona and workflows
- `configuration-files.md` - Simplify precedence to 2 levels
- `claude-md-coordination.md` - Simplify "team" language to "git"

These cleanups are **cosmetic** - the core technical designs are sound. Can be done during or after Phase 1 implementation.
