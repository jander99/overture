# Deep Archive - EMPTY

**Status:** All files deleted (2025-01-12)

---

## What Happened

This directory previously contained 17 research files (~7,500 lines) from Overture's early development:

**Component Research (5 files):**

- Consolidated into `../claude-code-components.md`

**Configuration Research (3 files):**

- Incorporated into `/docs/architecture.md`

**Implementation Planning (4 files):**

- Superseded by actual implementation
- Implementation details available in git history

**Historical Decisions (4 files):**

- Simplification, validation, theory docs
- No longer needed

**Workflow Examples (1 file):**

- Jira integration example
- Not relevant to current scope

---

## Why Deleted

These files were removed because:

1. **Consolidated** - Content merged into active docs
2. **Superseded** - Replaced by newer research or implementation
3. **Historical only** - Documented abandoned approaches
4. **No unique value** - Information available elsewhere

---

## For Current Research

See parent directories:

- `../` - Active research documents (4 high-value decision docs)
- `../../` - Updated research documents (3-client focus)
