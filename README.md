# Overture

> Configuration orchestrator and documentation generator for AI-assisted development

**Overture eliminates configuration chaos across AI development tools.**

Declare your AI tool setup once. Sync everywhere. Work better together.

> **✨ What's New (December 2024):** OpenCode integration is here! Overture now supports OpenCode with intelligent JSON patching that preserves your custom agents, commands, permissions, and themes while managing MCP servers. [See Example 7: Hybrid Claude Code + OpenCode Setup](./docs/examples.md#example-7-opencode--claude-code-hybrid-setup)

---

## The Problem

Developers using AI-assisted tools face **configuration chaos**:

### Multiple AI Tools, Multiple Configs

- **Claude Code** (user) → `~/.claude.json`
- **Claude Code** (project) → `./.mcp.json`
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** (user) → `~/.config/github-copilot/mcp.json`
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** (project) → `./.github/mcp.json`
- **OpenCode** → `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` and `./opencode.json`

### The Pain Points

- ❌ Same MCP server configured in 3 different places, 3 different ways
- ❌ Outdated configs from experiments lingering everywhere
- ❌ Install `python-development` plugin → manually configure `python-repl` MCP separately
- ❌ No way to know which MCPs enhance which plugins
- ❌ Can't share team AI workflows in version control
- ❌ Claude/Copilot don't know "use memory to persist discoveries"

**You've been experimenting with AI tools. Your config is a mess. Overture fixes it.**

---

## The Solution: Four Pillars

### 1. 🔧 Multi-Platform MCP Configuration Manager

**Single source of truth across all AI tools.**

Declare MCP servers once in `~/.config/overture/config.yml`. Sync everywhere.

```yaml
# ~/.config/overture/config.yml - Your canonical AI config
mcp:
  github:
    command: mcp-server-github
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: '${GITHUB_TOKEN}'

  memory:
    command: mcp-server-memory
```

```bash
overture sync
→ Updates Claude Desktop config
→ Updates Claude Code user config
→ Updates Claude Code project .mcp.json (only unique MCPs)
→ Updates OpenCode config (preserves custom agents/commands)
→ Updates Copilot configs (if installed)
```

**Smart deduplication:** Project configs reference global MCPs without redefining them.

```yaml
# my-project/.overture/config.yaml
mcp:
  github:

  python-repl:
    command: uvx
    args: [mcp-server-python-repl]
```

**Dotfiles integration:** Commit `~/.config/overture/config.yml` to your dotfiles repo. New machine? `overture sync` and you're ready.

---

### 2. 🔌 Plugin Lifecycle Manager

**User global + project-specific plugins with smart precedence.**

```yaml
# ~/.config/overture/config.yml
plugins:
  python-development:
    marketplace: claude-code-workflows

# my-project/.overture/config.yaml
plugins:
  python-development:

  kubernetes-operations:
    marketplace: claude-code-workflows
```

```bash
overture sync
→ Skips python-development (already installed globally)
→ Installs kubernetes-operations for this project only
→ Updates CLAUDE.md: "Active plugins for this project: [...]"
```

**Team alignment:** Commit `.overture/config.yaml` to project repos. New team members run `overture sync` and get the exact plugin setup.

---

### 3. 📚 Agent Skills Synchronization

**Reusable instruction sets distributed across all AI clients.**

Create skills once. Use everywhere.

```bash
# Create a skill in your config repo
mkdir -p ~/.config/overture/skills/debugging
cat > ~/.config/overture/skills/debugging/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: debugging
description: Advanced debugging techniques for complex issues
---

# Debugging Skill

When debugging:
1. Reproduce the issue consistently
2. Use binary search to isolate the problem
3. Check logs and stack traces
4. Test hypotheses systematically
5. Verify the fix
EOF

# Sync skills to all clients
overture sync
→ ~/.claude/skills/debugging/SKILL.md (Claude Code)
→ ~/.github/skills/debugging/SKILL.md (Copilot CLI)
→ ~/.opencode/skill/debugging/SKILL.md (OpenCode)

# Share with your team via git
overture skill cp debugging
git add .claude/skills/ .github/skills/ .opencode/skill/
git commit -m "Add debugging skill"
```

**Skills provide:**

- Consistent workflows across your team
- Domain-specific best practices
- Tool usage guidance
- Project-specific conventions

### 4. 📝 AI Context Documentation Generator

**Generate rich CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md files with workflow orchestration.**

Move beyond "here's what we found via grep" to **actionable AI guidance**.

```yaml
# .overture/config.yaml
documentation:
  workflows:
    - name: 'TDD with AI assistance'
      trigger: 'When writing tests'
      instructions: |
        1. Use context7 MCP to look up testing library best practices
        2. Use memory MCP to check previous test patterns in this project
        3. Use python-repl MCP to validate test assertions
        4. Store new patterns in memory for future reference

    - name: 'API implementation with research'
      trigger: 'When implementing API endpoints'
      instructions: |
        1. Use context7 to fetch latest FastAPI documentation
        2. Use memory to retrieve project API design patterns
        3. Use ruff MCP for linting as you code
        4. Persist architectural decisions in memory

  agent_mcp_mappings:
    python-development:python-pro:
      mcps:
        memory: 'Persist architectural decisions and patterns discovered'
        context7: 'Always look up latest library docs before implementing'
        python-repl: 'Validate complex logic before committing'
```

**Generated CLAUDE.md includes:**

- Active plugins for this project
- Global vs project MCPs
- **Workflow instructions that orchestrate multiple MCPs together**
- Agent/skill → MCP usage guidance

**This is the magic:** Overture teaches Claude **how to use your tools together**, not just which tools exist.

## Building from Source

Want to try the latest features or contribute to Overture? Build from source:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+ (v22.16+ recommended)
- **npm** v10+
- **Git**

### Installation Steps

**Quick Install (recommended):**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/overture.git
cd overture

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run the install script (builds + links globally)
./scripts/install-dev.sh
```

**Manual Install:**

```bash
# 1. Clone and install dependencies (same as above)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/overture.git
cd overture
npm install

# 2. Build all packages
npx nx build @overture/cli

# 3. Install the CLI globally for testing
# IMPORTANT: Must be run from apps/cli directory, not workspace root
cd apps/cli
npm link
cd ../..

# 4. Verify installation
overture --version
overture doctor

# 5. Run tests to verify everything works
npx nx test @overture/cli
```

### Development Workflow

**Quick Rebuild (recommended):**

```bash
# After making code changes, rebuild and relink
./scripts/install-dev.sh

# Test immediately
overture doctor
overture sync --dry-run
```

**Manual Rebuild:**

```bash
# Rebuild the CLI (npm link will automatically use the updated code)
npx nx build @overture/cli

# Test immediately using the 'overture' command
overture doctor
overture sync --dry-run

# Watch mode: Auto-rebuild on file changes (optional)
npx nx watch --projects=@overture/cli -- npx nx build @overture/cli
```

**Testing and quality:**

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode during development
npx nx test @overture/cli --watch

# Run all tests with coverage
npx nx test @overture/cli --coverage

# Build for production
npx nx build @overture/cli --configuration=production

# Lint code
npx nx lint @overture/cli
```

**How npm link works:**

- Creates a symlink from global `overture` → `apps/cli/bin/overture`
- The bin script runs `dist/apps/cli/main.js`
- After rebuilding, changes are immediately available via `overture` command
- No need to re-run `npm link` after each build

### Uninstalling

**Quick Uninstall (recommended):**

```bash
./scripts/uninstall-dev.sh
```

**Manual Uninstall:**

```bash
# When done developing, unlink the local version
cd apps/cli
npm unlink
cd ../..

# To switch to the published version from npm
npm install -g @overture/cli
```

### Troubleshooting

**Command not found after `npm link`:**

- Verify npm global bin directory is in your PATH:
  ```bash
  npm bin -g
  echo $PATH
  ```
- Manually add to PATH if needed (add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
  ```bash
  export PATH="$(npm bin -g):$PATH"
  ```

**Build errors:**

- Clear Nx cache: `npx nx reset`
- Delete `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Ensure Node.js version is v18+: `node --version`

## Why Overture?

### Without Overture

**Configuration Hell:**

- Install `python-development` plugin manually
- Separately configure `python-repl` MCP in `.mcp.json`
- Repeat for Copilot CLI, OpenCode, etc.
- Duplicate config across similar projects
- No guidance for Claude on which tools to use together
- Config drift across machines

**Claude's perspective:**

- ❌ Doesn't know which MCPs work best with which plugins
- ❌ No workflow orchestration guidance
- ❌ Trial and error to discover tool combinations

### With Overture

**Configuration Harmony:**

- Declare config ONCE in `~/.config/overture/config.yml`
- `overture sync` updates ALL platforms automatically
- Project configs reference globals (no duplication)
- Intelligent JSON patching for OpenCode (preserves custom agents, commands, themes)
- Commit `.overture/config.yaml` to version control
- Team members get consistent setup

**Claude's perspective:**

- ✅ Reads CLAUDE.md and knows which MCPs to use
- ✅ Has workflow instructions: "context7 → memory → python-repl"
- ✅ Better AI assistance through better guidance

**Overture turns AI tool chaos into AI tool harmony.**

### Key Differentiators

**Claude Code** ([docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview))

- Only CLI that can run as both MCP client AND server
- Rich plugin ecosystem with hooks for automation
- Web, iOS, and Slack access for coding on-the-go
- Project-scoped configuration via `.mcp.json`

**GitHub Copilot CLI** ([docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli))

- Deep GitHub integration (PRs, issues, repos, Actions)
- Custom agents via `.github/agents/` directory
- **Built-in GitHub MCP** - Overture automatically excludes 'github' MCP to prevent conflicts
- `/delegate` for async background work via cloud coding agent
- Session persistence with `--resume` and `--continue`

**OpenCode** ([docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/))

- Open-source AI coding agent (MIT license)
- Granular permissions system (ask/allow/deny per tool/command)
- Built-in agent system: Build, Plan, General, Explore
- OAuth support for remote MCP servers
- Plugin SDK and LSP integration
- Conversation sharing via `/share`
- Variable substitution: `{env:VAR}`, `{file:path}`

¹ **Extensibility Convergence:** All three CLIs now support the [Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/agent-skills) open standard—a portable format for defining reusable agent capabilities via `SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter. Skills created for one CLI work across all three (with minor path differences). Custom Agents use similar markdown-based definitions across platforms.

> **Note:** Overture v0.3+ focuses on these 3 production-ready clients. Previous versions supported 8 clients (including Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, JetBrains). See [Migration Notes](#migration-from-v02x-to-v03) for upgrade guidance.

### Why These 3 Clients?

**Claude Code** - Industry-leading capabilities, robust MCP support, rich ecosystem  
**Copilot CLI** - Deep GitHub integration, enterprise adoption, Agent Skills support  
**OpenCode** - Open-source, highly configurable, community-driven development

These clients represent the best-in-class options for AI-assisted development with MCP support
