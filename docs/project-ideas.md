## Core Ideas

Multiple companies are releasing tools for engineers to utilize to write code with their language model of choice.

- Claude Code
- OpenAI Codex
- Google Gemini
- Github Copilot
- ???
- Various IDEs such as VSCode, Jetbrains, Cursor, etc

These tools all have varying capabilities and Overture is the tool that pulls everything together. Users will need the ability to make their CLI and Desktop IDE tools' configurations portable to some degree. Claude Code is typically the leader in featureset, however other tools are coming up with similar features and this is where Overture will assist.

Overture will handle configurations at the project level as well as a global user configuration. This is similar in practice to how Claude Code will read mcp server configuration from a file in a project (mcp.json) as well as a file for the user (Claude's settings.json)

Overture should also manage which Claude Code plugins a user has subscribed to.

### MCP Sync

Overture should provide for the ability for users to persist multiple mcp servers per project as well as a set of global mcp servers the user prefers to use regardless of project.
